General Thoughts
It was my first time to get professional training in programming.
Hence, almost everything was brand-new to me.
So completing these practicals can be seen as a huge challenge for me.
Fortunately, I have got great help from teachers and classmates to successfully conquer all the difficulties.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems, how to write simple programs in Python and so on.
It is great to find something behind the screen and how it actually is.
But I think that the most important thing I learned was thinking independently.
Due to the special online-teaching circumstance, when I came across some problems, I learned to think independently instead of immediately turning to others for assistance.


Response to Formative Feedback
I found the formative feedback quite helpful and thorough.
From the feedback, I noticed that I often miss some important requirement in the guidance, which led to the loss of some functions.
It helped me to revise the past practicals and reminded me to be more careful in the following practicals.
