The practical was not easy, especially for the understanding of the last task. 
I tried to use my codes to find points that were infected and infecting its neighbours but failed, so I finally just used the provided codes. 
It is a little bit frustrating that the final pictures were not similar to the guidance's.
But generally, the practical was interesting, which let me have a great understanding of the SIR model.
